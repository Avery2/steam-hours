# steam-hours
Analyzing data pulled from steam API to see how many hours I've played.

Use python to do API requests and output a csv file. Read csv with the Rmd file to do analysis. Output to gh-pages.

Go to your steam profile and copy the number in the url. Replace the `steamid` variable in the python file to fetch your information.
